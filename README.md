# PETLOG

This is a small web project to log pet's activities in a day-to-day basis. 

It is build with solely Django 4.2, Postgres, Celery and Redis.

## Spinning it up

To run the app, you need a `.env` file with the environment variables you need to configure, like in `.env.example`, and docker/docker-compose installed.

If you have that, you can run `docker-compose up` and it will be up and running on `localhost:8000`.
